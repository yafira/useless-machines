# ⚙️ Useless Machines

A playful web archive of useless machines, absurd inventions, and delightfully impractical devices.
Inspired by chindōgu, esoteric programming, speculative design, and the sheer joy of things that don't work the way you'd expect — or don't work at all.

## 💭 Why Useless?

Because function isn't everything. Because failure is interesting.
Because sometimes the machine works best when it doesn’t work at all.
