				<h2><i class="fas fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> Useless Machines</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Useless Machines</strong> is a playful web archive of absurd
					inventions and delightfully impractical devices. Inspired by chindōgu,
					esoteric programming, and speculative design, it celebrates objects
					that serve no clear purpose — and that's the point. From intentionally
					broken gadgets to fictional contraptions, this collection is a joyful
					meditation on creativity, failure, and the strange beauty of things
					that don’t work the way you'd expect — or don’t work at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					This archive was originally inspired by the course
					<a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/ima/useless-machines/" target="_blank"
						>Useless MAchines</a
					>, taught at NYU’s ITP/IMA by Blair Simmons.
				</p>

				<h3><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> About the Course</h3>
				<p>
					<em>Useless Machines</em> is about redefining “usefulness.” Through
					making, students explore what it means — ideologically, politically,
					and historically — to create something ‘useful’ or ‘useless.’ The
					course encourages playful experimentation with these definitions,
					revealing how such objects can be humorous, critical, disruptive, and
					at times... even functional.
				</p>
				<p>
					The class studies “useless” machines throughout history, prompting
					conversations and disagreements around the implications of existing
					and emerging technologies. Students design their own useless machines
					as final projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of inspiration include: <br />
					— Kenji Kawakami’s
					<em>The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions</em><br />
					— Dunne & Raby’s <em>Speculative Everything</em><br />
					— Stephanie Dinkins’ <em>Conversations with Bina48</em><br />
					— esoteric.codes <br />
					— CW&T<br />
					— Mimi Ọnụọha’s <em>Missing Data</em><br />
					— Jacques Carelman’s <em>Catalog of Impossible Objects</em><br />
					— Viral videos, conceptual artworks, and techno-absurdist devices
				</p>

				<h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> About Blair Simmons</h3>
				<p>
					Blair Simmons is an Assistant Arts Professor at NYU's Interactive
					Telecommunications Program (ITP) and Interactive Media Arts (IMA)
					departments, where they teach critical technology theory and
					community-driven courses such as <em>Useless Machines</em> and
					<em>Technology and Communication</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					They are a queer and anxious artist, curator, researcher, storyteller,
					and technician working in as many mediums as will have them. Their
					work explores themes of technology, labor, bodies, and pain — often
					created through a process that mimics the wear and tear of labor
					itself: warping, distorting, grinding, and breaking down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blair’s practice is both dependent on and critical of technology,
					reflecting how tech can simultaneously ease and exacerbate their
					experience of chronic pain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Their research manifests in objects and performances showcased at
					venues such as Pioneer Works, La MaMa’s CultureHub, Wordhack at
					Babycastles, theBlanc, Honor Fraser Gallery, and the Edinburgh Fringe
					Festival. Their work has been featured in publications including
					<em>The New York Times</em>, <em>PARtake</em>, <em>The Scotsman</em>,
					<em>USA Today</em>, and <em>The Guardian</em>.

				<h3><i class="fas fa-circle-question"></i> Why Useless?</h3>
				<p>
					Because function isn't everything. Because failure is interesting.
					Because sometimes the machine works best when it doesn’t work at all.
